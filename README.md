# FDD Analysis Feedback Extension

This is an extension for Tableau.


This Extension provides users with the ability to see the areas where the FDD routine was not sure whether there was an error, in a table structure, 
filter the Tableau view to show only these areas with the click of a button, and show the underlying data of any selected datapoints. After this manual Analysis,
a user can then give feedback to the FDD routine, whether the data was faulty or not.
